### Member Portal Authorised Contacts

MEMBER CRM has the feature of giving a member the option to create contacts for their account. This allows members have family members or business representatives associated to the account, to allow them to receive the benefits in their stead, or have emergency contacts. This feature can be greatly customised to allow anyone to be a beneficiary, have portal access, or only allow them to be an active contact for a specified amount of time.

MEMBER CRM also keeps an audit of all members, current and archived, in a list to view at any time.
