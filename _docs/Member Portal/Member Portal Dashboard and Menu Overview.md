Member Portal Dashboard and Menu Overview

The Member Portal is the access point for employees to view and manage their contributions and claims, as well as their account details.

The Dashboard is the landing page for members for the portal. The page displays a general overview of the memberâ€™s account and recent activity.

The Dashboard also displays information for members on how to apply for long service leave.
