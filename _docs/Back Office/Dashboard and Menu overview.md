### Dashboard and Menu Overview

MEMBER CRM’s back office is where administrators and operators view, edit, and create returns, invoices, reports and more for administration and management purposes.

The Dashboard is the landing page for back office operators. From here a back office operator can manage new company registrations, verify new workers, and processing returns or claims. The dashboard also features a task list for the back office operator (My Activities).

MEMBER CRM captures several hundred discrete actions performed by all users in the system and serves these actions up in a timeline (aka activity feed). The timeline is displayed on key pages such as a company or member’s profile and is the key ingredients in delivering exceptional KPI reporting and insights into stakeholder activity.

MEMBER CRM’s menu system provides back office operators seamless access to all areas of the system, while the top bar allows back office operators to edit their profile, switch between Funds, and access the administration components of the system.
